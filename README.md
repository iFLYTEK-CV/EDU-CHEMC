# EDU-CHEMC
This repository is an official data link of paper "**Handwritten Chemical Structure Image to Structure-Specific Markup Using Random Conditional Guided Decoder**" in ACM MultiMedia 2023. 

We have officially released a handwritten chemical structure image dataset named **EDU-CHEMC**, which comprises a total of 52,987 images of handwritten molecular structures collected in educational scenarios. The official download link is available at **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s-diCMMvfAspWmD8AbiKBhF_0uzSwy6m**

The EDU-CHEMC database has been instrumental in supporting the **ICDAR 2024 Competition on Recognition of Chemical Structures**.

To access the competition site and utilize valuable annotation tools, please visit: **https://crocs-ifly-ustc.github.io/crocs/index.html** .

In connection with this, we have extended our methodology, which has been published in the AAAI 2025 conference.
